# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

    I was instructed to update the code to follow accessibility standards so that the site is optimized for search engines.  After reviewing the source code in index.html and style.css there were a few updates to be made.

    First, I gave the website a descritive title, "Horiseon", the name of the site. Then, I linked the id in the content section to the nav, to allow it to be more accessible and easy to browse.  I updated the old div tags to be more descriptive to the structure of the page (i.e, header, footer, section, aside, nav).  I provided all the images with alt tags for easy referencing.  Then, I gave the content section the same class to get rid of redundant code in the CSS style sheet.  Please see comments in index.html and CSS. 

    I feel that I met the acceptance criteria and followed the scouts rule to leave it cleaner than I found it. 

 ## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage that meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
